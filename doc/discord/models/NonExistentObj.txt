{{cls}} instance = NonExistentObj(url, typ, bot, data, edit)

{{desc}} Used for objects that have been deleted, useful for recreating
objects to get around Discord's no recreation policy. Basically, this is an
undo button

{{note}} This class shouldn't be initialized by hand as it doesn't do
anything too useful. This object is automatically initialized upon an
object's `delete()` call.

{{note}} Due to the nature of Discord's policy, ID and messages CANNOT be
restored.

{{param}} url [str]
    Where to post the data

{{param}} typ [class]
    The object to recreate, eg Text or Channel. This param is only used to
    recreate the object before it was deleted.

{{param}} bot [discord.Bot]
    The bot object

{{param}} data [dict]
    Params to recreate the object. This is used for simple params on
    creation like name or position

{{param}} edit [dict]
    How to edit the object after creation

{{param}} extras [list]
    Other requests to edit, used in the format [http_method, url, data]. The
    data MUST be a dict.

{{prop}} url [str]
    The URL provided

{{prop}} typ [class]
    The object's class

{{prop}} bot [discord.Bot]
    The bot object

{{prop}} dat [dict]
    Initial creation params

{{prop}} edt [dict]
    Post creation params

{{prop}} ext [list]
    Provided extras

{{fn}} await instance.undelete()

{{desc}} Recreates the object that was deleted. This process is not
perfect, however.

{{note}} Here are the things that CANNOT be restored: IDs, messages,
members, the roles that members have, the members that a role has, roles
upon a guild's creation, etc. If you must recreate those, use the extras
upon initialization.

{{rtn}} The recreated object
